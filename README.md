# Air Canvas

Air Canvas is a computer vision-based application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures. It utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries for hand detection and tracking. This project was developed as a minor project by students of the CSE branch, CS-2 section, at Shri Ram Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Prof. Ruchi K Patel.

## Features

- Draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures.
- Choose from multiple colors (blue, green, red, yellow, and pink) for drawing.
- Clear the canvas with a simple hand gesture.
- Save the canvas drawing as an image file on the local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saatvik1512/Air-Canvas.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the Python script:
